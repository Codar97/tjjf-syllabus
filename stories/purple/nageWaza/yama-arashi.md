## Tips
* Keep hold with left hand to ensure you don't get hit by the katana
* Very similar to harai goshi except yama arashi is more of a hand throw so you pull uke onto hips
* Ensure your left hand goes through uke's grip and on the top of uke's right wrist
* Keep arms bent and close to uke. Don't extend out your grip 
* Get your body in close to uke when throwing to help pull uke onto hips and sweep
